# TypeScript Automobile Simulator
  The goal here is to create a web-application using TypeScript which models all of the components and functions of an automobile.
  Maybe we can see how certain variable changes impact fuel efficiency or temperature control.
  I'd like to eventually get this down to the point that you can stress-test an engine with semi-realistic engine-wear effects.

### Dependencies
  TypeScript v3.2.2
  Toastr? (Not sure yet.)
